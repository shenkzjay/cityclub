An early goal from Ugo put a dent on what was an exciting start for Team B.

Their efforts to battle back suffered a major blow as Coach volley home from distance, capping a fine performance all morning.

Team B was awarded a controversial penalty when a goal bound shot struck Cubasi's arm. Uche was there to convert but it wasn't enough to salvage something from the encounter.
