It was not until the 43rd minutes that Dan expertly slotted home from close range to give Team C the lead in the encounter.

Their celebration didn't last too long after the referee awarded a penalty to Team D for a handball by Hamza.

Lala couldn't capitalize as his effort missed the target by some margin

Team C responded with another goal in the 50th minute with KC near-post strike finding the back of the net.

Team D was then awarded another penalty for another handball by Hamza.

This time, Portugal stepped up to take the penalty, but went the same way as Lala's effort
