It was a battling encounter with both teams proving too strong for their opponents to breakdown

It wasn't until the 45th minute when Ola struck gold with a stunning left-foot volley to open the scoring.

Team A battled hard to find the equalizer but couldn't break the low-block defence mounted by Team B.

Team B grabbed all 3 points to moving them 2nd in the league table on goal difference.
