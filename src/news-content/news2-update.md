There was not much to seperate between the two teams
as both sides appeared evenly matched

Until Engr Segun controversial goal gave his team the much needed
3 points in the encounter.

The opponents, Team B protested for an earlier foul on their keeper - Chris, which the match official - Benito waved on as fair play.
